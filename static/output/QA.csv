However, marine ecosystems are facing significant challenges today. Nearly a third of the world's fish stocks are overexploited, which is not sustainable. The oceans are becoming more acidic due to increased carbon dioxide levels, with acidity rising by 26% since the start of the industrial revolution. Furthermore, pollution is a major issue, with approximately 13,000 pieces of plastic litter found on every square kilometer of ocean. These challenges threaten the health of marine ecosystems and the livelihoods of those who depend on them."

This includes combating desertification, halting and reversing land degradation, and addressing biodiversity loss."
"18. **Peace and Justice**: How do peace and justice relate to sustainable development, and what are the goals aimed at promoting these values?","Peace and justice are fundamental to sustainable development because they create the conditions necessary for people to thrive, work, learn, and raise families. Without peace, societies cannot develop effectively, and without justice, there can be no lasting peace. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.
